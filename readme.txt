A problem set is a series of classic problems in an
 introductory programming course. For these exercises, you must 
 write your own functions from scratch. So you may not, for example,
 import a python function from another module, or use typecasting to
 make a problem trivial. You will have about a week to complete a 
 problem set, and a small amount 
of class time to work on the project.
